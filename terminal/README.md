# [Multiverse] Go Terminal Library
This library provides an easy to use interface to interact with an operating
system terminal. From just submitting commands, to rendering simple and complex
text, ANSI formatting (color, style), and other UI tools. The components are
divided into modular packages so various aspects of the library can be used
indepedently. This package however is used frequently throughout Multiverse OS
because it is heavily used in the Multiverse Go command-line interface (cli)
framework.
